## Romeo GPT - An AI Assistant for Document Analysis

Romeo GPT is an AI assistant that allows users to upload a list of documents and ask questions about the content. The application is built using FastAPI, Redisearch, and OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Project Requirements and Installation

To run this project, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If you don't have them already, please follow the installation guides below:

- Docker installed on your system
- Python 3.10 or later installed on your system
- Basic understanding of FastAPI, Docker Compose, and Redis

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file with the following variables:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   ```
   Replace <your_openai_api_key> with your own OpenAI API key.


## Deploying the Application Locally

- Run the following command to deploy the application:

   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
This command will build the Docker images and start the containers.


## Accessing the Application
The application will be available at:
- FastAPI Server: http://localhost:8000
- Redis Browser: http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser


## Testing the Application
To test the application, you can use the FastAPI autogenerated documentation by visiting http://localhost:8000/docs. This will provide you with an interactive interface to upload documents and ask questions about the content.
- Go to the /upload-files/ endpoint and upload your documents. The supported file formats are PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
- Use the /ask-question/ endpoint to ask a question about the uploaded documents. The AI assistant will analyze the most relevant document and provide an answer based on its content.
